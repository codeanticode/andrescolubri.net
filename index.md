Hello! My name is Andr√©s Colubri. I'm computational scientist and media artist, and assistant professor in the [Program of Bioinformatics and Integrative Biology](https://www.umassmed.edu/bioinformatics/){:target="_blank"} at the University Massachusetts Medical School. The [Colubri Laboratory](https://co-labo.org/){:target="_blank"} (or Co-Labo for short) focuses on digital epidemiology, mobile health, and visualization of biomedical data.

Here you can find information about my art and science projects, courses I have taught in the past, publications, and occasional blog posts.
