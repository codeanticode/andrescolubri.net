After a very long time, I finally updated my website (and blog)... and here it is! Well, most of it, at least the basic structure of the site is in place, with a number of sections at the top (about, art, code, etc.) which I hope you find useful to navigate the site. Meanwhile, my previous [codeanticode blog](https://codeanticode.wordpress.com/) will not receive any further updates, but will continue to be online as an archival of older projects, as well as my [homepage](http://users.design.ucla.edu/~acolubri/home/) at the Design Media Arts user site.

Many thanks to Chris Tomkins-Tinch, who pointed me to [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), which is an easy-to-use static website generator. [This post](http://bryancshepherd.com/Setting-up-Bluehost-DNS-for-a-GitHub-Jekyll-blog/) on setting up Bluehost DNS to point to a GitHub Jekyll site was very useful as well. So far, Jekyll has been really convenient to create this site and, luckily, to do some blogging again!
