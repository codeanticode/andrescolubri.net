Hello! My name is Andr√©s Colubri, and here you can find information about my scientific, artistic, and coding projects, as well as my teaching experience and publications.

I originally studied mathematics, and now work in biomedical informatics. I also use computer code and scientific data to create art projects and software tools for scientists and artists. I'm a computational scientist in the [Sabeti Lab](https://www.sabetilab.org/){:target="_blank"} at the Broad Institute of Harvard and MIT, and a senior developer in the [Processing project](https://processing.org/){:target="_blank"}.
