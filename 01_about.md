My name is Andr√©s Colubri, and here you can find information about my scientific, artistic, and coding projects.

I originally studied mathematics, and now work in biomedical informatics. I also use computer code and scientific data to create art projects and tools for scientists and artists. I'm a researcher in the [Sabeti Lab](https://www.sabetilab.org/) at the Broad Institute of Harvard and MIT, and a senior developer in the [Processing project](https://processing.org/).
