I mentored several college students participating in the [Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/){:target="_blank"} (GSoC) program, under the sponsorship of the [Processing Foundation](https://processingfoundation.org/initiatives/google-summer-of-code). These students worked in different projects related to the Android mode and video library in Processing: 

* GSoC 2017 (ongoing): [Build system migration from Ant to Gradle](https://procandsoc17.wordpress.com/) by Rupak Das, and [VR Mode Demo in Processing for Android](https://picorana.github.io/blog) by Sarah Di Barolomeo. In this second project, the "official" mentor is [Gottfried Haider](http://ghai.xyz/), and I'm only providing general feedback about the VR library in the Android mode.

* GSoC 2015: [Enhancements in Processingâ€™s Android mode](http://omerjerk.in/index.php/2015/08/15/gsoc-2015-the-processing-foundation/) by Umair Khan.

* GSoC 2014: [Android Mode for Processing 3.0](https://www.google-melange.com/archive/gsoc/2014/orgs/processing/projects/imilka.html) by Imil Ziyaztdinov, and [New video library using GStreamer 1.x](https://github.com/gstreamer-java/gir2java/wiki/GSOC-2014-report) by Roland Elek.
