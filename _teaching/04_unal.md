I have been working with profesor Jean Pierre Charalambos at the [Department of Computing and Systems Engineering](https://www.ingenieria.bogota.unal.edu.co/formacion/pregrado/ingenieria-de-sistemas-y-computacion){:target="_blank"} at the Universidad Nacional de Colombia (UNAL), sede Bogotá, since 2010 in the development of a graduate-level course on Visual Computing for their master students. This course offers a foundation for interactive computer graphics, which students can use to develop their individual final projects. Most of the lectures are available online:

* [Introduction to Visual Computing](https://visualcomputing.github.io/Introduction/#/1)
* [Introduction to Git](https://visualcomputing.github.io/git/#/1)
* [Cognitive Aspects of Visual Computing](http://visualcomputing.github.io/Cognitive/#/1)
* [Geometry transformations](https://visualcomputing.github.io/Transformations/#/1)
* [Representation with polygonal meshes](https://visualcomputing.github.io/representation/#/1)
* [Colors](https://visualcomputing.github.io/colors/#/1)
* [Curves](https://visualcomputing.github.io/Curves/#/1)
* [GLSL shaders](http://visualcomputing.github.io/Shaders/#/1)
