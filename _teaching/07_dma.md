While I was doing my MFA at the Design Media Arts department at UCLA, I had the chance to be the Teaching Assistant in some undergraduate courses for the design program. In particular, I was the TA for the Interactivity 28 course in the [Fall of 2008](http://classes.dma.ucla.edu/Fall08/28/){:target="_blank"}, which provides an introduction to programming to design students and continues to be taught to this day.
