I have been teaching and mentoring students for several years, across different topics (computational arts, bioinformatics, engineering) and settings (college and graduate school, summer programs, internships). Passing along knowledge and experience is one of the most rewarding experiences I have had, and one where I believe I learned as much as my students did.
