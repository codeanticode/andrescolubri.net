# Personal site

This is the repository of my personal site. I created it with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), and found [this Jekyll tutorial](https://www.taniarascia.com/make-a-static-website-with-jekyll/) from [Tania Rascia](https://www.taniarascia.com/) very helpful to learn how to customize the default Jekyll theme.
