I make individual and collaborative art projects that rely on computer code, user interaction, and data from different sources (typically scientific, although that's not always the case). With these projects, I try to create a personal narrative that brings together my interest in art, science, and technology.

In 2009, I received an MFA degree from the [Design Media Arts Department](http://dma.ucla.edu/) at the University of California, Los Angeles. My thesis project was about the practice of live cinema, and the use of different techniques (digital drawing, real-time video) in a performance I created based on memories of the Challenger disaster. The written thesis is available [here]({{ site.url }}/assets/art/colubri-mfa_thesis-ucla.pdf).
