description: Visualization of protein folding simulations

Convergence-Divergence is a visualization of all the folding simulations I generated during [my research](http://portfolio.andrescolubri.net/articles/jmb2006_intrabasin_colubri.pdf){:target="_blank"}
on protein folding, for a particular protein called [ubiquitin](http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/explore/explore.do?structureId=1ubq){:target="_blank"}. These visualization 
shows the convergence of the simulations towards the native conformation, and diverging from the initial random coil:

Since each simulation run generates a slightly different (sometimes incorrect) result, the only way to gain some understanding from these computations is by inspecting the entire ensemble
of predictions and determining the most likely outcome of the folding algorithm.

These visualizations are available upon request in high-resolution suitable for printing.
