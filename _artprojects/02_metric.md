Metric Spaces is a visualization of the search paths of users of the visual exploration tool [Mirador](https://fathom.info/mirador/){:target="_blank"}. As the user navigates through the 
variables of a dataset, Mirador calculates the ["information distance"](https://fathom.info/notebook/12395/){:target="_blank"} between each pair of visible variables, and updates this 
distance to reflect changes effected through the UI, like sorting variables or filtering the data.

Different users would probably explore the same data sets in different ways, which would lead to different search paths, so this visualization could reveal those differences, 
and perhaps also the biases built into Mirador's UI that may be constraining the users to search certain parts of the entire data space:
