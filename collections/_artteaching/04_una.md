During the Fall of 2009, I taught a post-graduate course at the [Universidad Nacional de las Artes](http://una.edu.ar/){:target="_blank"} (UNA), in Buenos Aires, Argentina (back then called Instituto Universitario Nacional de las Artes or IUNA). This course, named Mathematics Applied to Digital Arts, had as a goal to provide mathematical concepts and techniques needed to work with computer code and electronics.
