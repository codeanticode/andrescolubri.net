Between 2010 and 2011, I taught several undergraduate and graduate level courses for the students in the life sciences program in the [College of Applied Life Sciences](http://www.jejunu.ac.kr/eng/colleges/todaud){:target="_blank"} at Jeju National University, in South Korea.

I taught the following four courses in the Spring semester of 2010 (click on the link to the right to download the slides):

* Systems Biology [(slides)]({{ site.url }}/assets/teaching/jeju/Spring2010-SysBio.zip)
* Biochemistry [(slides)]({{ site.url }}/assets/teaching/jeju/Spring2010-Biochem.zip)
* Biostatistics [(slides)]({{ site.url }}/assets/teaching/jeju/Spring2010-Biostats.zip)
* English for Biotechnology [(slides)]({{ site.url }}/assets/teaching/jeju/Spring2010-English4Biotech.zip)

However, two of these classes were shared with other professors in the College of Life Sciences. During the Fall semester of 2010, I taught three courses:

* Bioinformatics Programming [(slides)]({{ site.url }}/assets/teaching/jeju/Fall2010-Bioinformatics.zip)
* Functional Genomics [(slides)]({{ site.url }}/assets/teaching/jeju/Fall2010-FunGenomics.zip)
* Chemistry for Life Sciences [(slides)]({{ site.url }}/assets/teaching/jeju/Fall2010-Chem4LifeSciences.zip)
