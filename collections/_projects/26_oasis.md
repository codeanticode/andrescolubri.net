OASIS is an experimental, independent art platform designed to connect artists with space providers and audiences in the local communities, initially conceptualized by Jihyun Kim and myself. The main goals of this platform are (1) to make more spaces available to artists to show their work, (2) to give space providers a unique channel to announce the availability of their spaces and the type of work they are looking for, and (3) to provide audiences the means to find and experience the artworks currently on display and to connect with local creators. It is available at https://oasis.art.

## A physical-digital nexus

Our motivation with OASIS was to support interactions between artists, hosts, and audiences at the juncture between online and local communities. With the current prototype, we explored the interstitial spaces suitable for art exhibition throughout the urban fabric and facilitating the movements of “micro-publics” towards these spaces. This aspect of OASIS is fundamental; even though the web app is an important component of OASIS, the platform should not be seen as (yet another) “Social Network for the Arts”, but rather as a physical-digital nexus that taps on the potential of mobile and web technologies to enable new possibilities for dialog, interaction, and creation within our communities.

## Virtual events and spaces

After a process of design and development that started in 2018 and picked up momentum in 2019, our plans included a first community pilot in early 2020. The COVID-19 pandemic obviously affected these plans, and we had to put the project on hold for some time while we were all going through the disruption and difficulties caused by the pandemic. By the end of 2020, we become aware of the possibilities offered by several online platforms for virtual art events and we resumed work on OASIS focusing on the inclusion support of virtual events hosted on Mozilla Hubs and Gather.Town. Througout 2021, we organized a series of virtual and hybrid events involving artists from the Cambridge community and also abroad.
