Metric Spaces is a visualization of the search trajectories of users of the visual exploration tool [Mirador](https://fathom.info/mirador/){:target="_blank"}. As the user navigates through the
variables of a dataset, Mirador calculates the ["information distance"](https://fathom.info/notebook/12395/){:target="_blank"} between each pair of visible variables, and updates this
distance to reflect changes effected through the UI, like sorting variables or filtering data.

Different users will explore the same data sets in different ways, which would lead to different search paths, so this visualization could reveal those differences.
It probably also shows the biases built into Mirador's UI that could be constraining the users to search within certain regions of the entire data space:

This work was shown as a print piece in the +Code group show, at the San Martin Cultural Center (Argentina) in 2015.
