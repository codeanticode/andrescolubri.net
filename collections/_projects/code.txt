I do research in exploratory data analysis and predictive modeling of infectious diseases.

My art projects seek to incorporate spontaneous human interaction and intuition into algorithmic systems. I also develop software tools to create code-based artworks.

I develop software tools for scientists, artists, and designers, and use some of those tools in my own creative projects. Most of my open source projects are hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/codeanticode){:target="_blank"}, and older projects can still be found on [Sourceforge](https://sourceforge.net/u/acolubri/profile/){:target="_blank"}.
