description: Proposal for an ad-hoc mesh radio network

---

This project proposes the concept of an ad-hoc mesh network of micro powered FM radio transmitters. They work as an autonomous Radio Bulletin Board System allowing anyone in the local community to phone in and add their message to a streaming broadcast. The system tries to be as cheap as possible using common off the shelf products and open source software. The system is designed to facilitate international connectivity between local communities through the use of Voice over IP. Members of a local community can become more connected by having a pervasive forum to voice their interests and concerns. Multiple communities with related interests can foster a sense of connectedness, even internationally. Collaboration with [David Elliott](https://github.com/taboularasa){:target="_blank"} and [Patrick Tierney](https://ced.berkeley.edu/ced/faculty-staff/patrick-tierney){:target="_blank"}. Exhibited at 2009 International Symposium of Electronic Arts (ISEA) in Ireland, and description published in the proceedings of the event.
