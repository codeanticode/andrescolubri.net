[Operation Outbreak](https://www.o2.education/){:target="_blank"} (O2) is a platform for infectious disease education, preparedness, and data generation created by [Sarasota Military Academy Prep school](http://www.sarasotamilitaryacademy.org/academics/sma-prep){:target="_blank"} and the [Sabeti lab](https://www.sabetilab.org/){:target="_blank"} at the Broad Institute of Harvard and MIT. O2 integrates an academic unit covering relevant science and humanities subjects with a culminating “outbreak simulation” experiential learning activity. This activity replicates a real-world outbreak scenario and guides hundreds of students on how to respond through a coordinated effort and use of technology, teaching them biology and public health in the process. I developed the O2 app that is used during the outbreak activity to simulate pathogen transmission over Bluetooth, symptoms of infected individuals, and the clinical outcome of patients. Thanks to a grant from [Toshiba America Foundation](https://www.toshiba.com/taf/){:target="_blank"}, I included support for Bluetooth beacons that can be incorporated into the simulation as infectious sources, protective items (masks, hazmat suits), or immunizing vaccines.
