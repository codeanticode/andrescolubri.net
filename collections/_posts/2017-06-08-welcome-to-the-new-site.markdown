After a very long time, I finally updated my website (and blog)... and here it is! Well, most of it, at least the basic structure of the site is in place, with a number of sections at the top (about, art, code, etc.) which I hope you find useful to navigate the site. Meanwhile, my previous [codeanticode blog](https://codeanticode.wordpress.com/){:target="_blank"} will not receive any further updates, but will continue to be online as an archival of older projects, as well as my [homepage](http://users.design.ucla.edu/~acolubri/home/){:target="_blank"} at the Design Media Arts user site.

Many thanks to Chris Tomkins-Tinch, who pointed me to [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/){:target="_blank"}, which is an easy-to-use static website generator. [This post](https://bryancshepherd.com/data-science/setting-bluehost-dns-github-jekyll-blog/){:target="_blank"} on setting up Bluehost DNS to point to a GitHub Jekyll site was very useful as well. So far, Jekyll has been really convenient to create this site and, luckily, to do some blogging again!
