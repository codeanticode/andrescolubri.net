This project consisted in the design of a visual score to project on the stage during the performance of the play [Crave](http://www.alternativateatral.com/obra6203-crave){:target="_blank"}.
This production of Crave, including the live projections, remained on the billboard from 2006 until 2009. A video excerpt is available below:

The digital projection was developed in collaboration with Fabricio Costa and Esteban Ulrich, using the custom-made software [Moldeo](http://moldeo.org/){:target="_blank"} for real-time animation, and received
a distinction in the category Stage Scene/Spatial Design from the 2006 edition of the “Teatro del Mundo” awards from the Rojas Cultural Center. The play was selected for the 2007 Porto Alegre
on Stage Festival (Brazil) and also for the 2007 International Theater Festival of Buenos Aires.

Since the screenplay did not have any directions about the "mise en scène", it opened the possibility of experimentation using the resource of real-time projection as the main visual element
on the stage. I developed custom shaders to process preselected background images and to generate the painterly animations seen during the play. A sequence of this transformation from a sample
image (not used during the play) into final painterly rendering is shown below:
