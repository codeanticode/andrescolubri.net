Relay is a prototype Augmented Reality app about participatory intervention in public spaces. Designated spots in the city with Relay
posters could be "annotated" by users of the app, who were able to write text in reply to what other users wrote earlier at that spot:

<div style="padding:56.25% 0 0 0;position:relative;"><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/52261096" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe></div><script src="https://player.vimeo.com/api/player.js"></script>

This project was conducted in collaboration with [Jihun Kim](http://cargocollective.com/jihyunkim){:target="_blank"} and [Terrence Fradet](http://tfradet.com/){:target="_blank"},
and won the first price at the AT&T Mobile Hackathon at MIT in 2012.

Relay is a result of [ideas developed originally with Jihyun](http://portfolio.andrescolubri.net/articles/isea2010_proceedings_itch_kim_colubri.pdf){:target="_blank"}
about the community appropriation and repurposing of mobile technologies in order to enable creative uses of these technologies.
My current work in [Processing for Android](http://android.processing.org/){:target="_blank"} tries to continue with those original aims, by providing tools for mobile
development that could lead to new and unexpected uses of Android devices.
