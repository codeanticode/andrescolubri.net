This is a selection of individual and collaborative projects across science, art, and technology. My current research focuses on exploratory data analysis and modeling of infectious diseases (see Mirador and Mobile Health), but I also contribute to several open source projects in the computational arts and design (Processing, Processing for Android, Moldeo). There are many serendipitous connections between these projects (for example, my early biomolecular visualizations became the basis for later live drawing projects, and Processing has been the basis of several pieces and tools I made over the years), but an overall narrative (looking in retrospect) is the use of code and mathematics to create tools that allow one to find visual patterns either in scientific data or in the data generated by their own users.
