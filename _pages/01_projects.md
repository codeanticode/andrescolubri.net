This is a selection of individual and collaborative projects in science, art, and code. My current research focuses on exploratory data analysis and modeling of infectious diseases (see Mirador and Mobile Health), but I also contribute to several open source projects in computational arts and design (Trazos, Processing, Syphon, Moldeo). Across this diverse range of projects and interests, a unifying thread is, at least in my own view, the use of code and mathematics to create tools allowing to find visual patterns either in scientific data or in the data generated by their own users.
