### Design Media Arts MFA Thesis

In 2009, I received an MFA degree from the [Design Media Arts Department](http://dma.ucla.edu/){:target="_blank"} at the University of California, Los Angeles. My thesis project was about the use of digital drawing and real-time video in live performance. The written thesis is available [here]({{ site.url }}/assets/publications/colubri-mfa_thesis-ucla.pdf).


### Mathematics Doctoral Thesis

My original background is in mathematics applied to the simulation of biopolymers (proteins and RNA). I obtained my PhD from the [department of Mathematics](http://www.matematica.uns.edu.ar/default.php){:target="_blank"} at the Universidad Nacional del Sur in Bah√≠a Blanca, Argentina, in 2002, for my work on the coarse-graining of stochastic processes to describe the folding of protein molecules ([thesis pdf]({{ site.url }}/assets/publications/colubri-phd_thesis-uns.pdf), in Spanish).

<!-- Current projects
================

* Differentially-Private Machine Learning for fast outbreak response: Creating and evaluating new ML algorithms that can allow model sharing in infectious disease reearch and outbreak response while protecting patient privacy.

* Unbiased visual exploration of biomedical data: Developing new statistical measures of false discovery that can be applied to exploratory data analysis.

* Predictive modeling of infectious diseases: Using clinical metadata to find patterns of disease manifestation and predictors of outcome.

Past projects
=============

* Protein folding prediction: Coarse-grained models to simulate ab-initio folding of protein molecules. -->
