I research computational methods to predict the diagnosis and outcome of infectious disease patients, using demographic, clinical, and genomic data. I also work on visual exploration tools to identify relevant patterns and predictors in biomedical datasets.

My original background is in mathematics applied to the simulation of biopolymers (proteins and RNA). I obtained my PhD from the [department of Mathematics](http://www.matematica.uns.edu.ar/default.php){:target="_blank"} at the Universidad Nacional del Sur in Bah√≠a Blanca, Argentina, in 2002, for my work on the coarse-graining of stochastic processes to describe the folding of protein molecules ([thesis pdf]({{ site.url }}/assets/science/colubri-phd_thesis-uns.pdf), in Spanish).


Current projects
================

* Differentially Private Machine Learning for fast outbreak response: Creating and evaluating new ML algorithms that can allow model sharing in infectious disease reearch and outbreak response while protecting patient privacy.

* Unbiased visual exploration of biomedical data: Developing new statistical measures of false discovery that can be applied to exploratory data analysis.

* Predictive modeling of infectious diseases: Using clinical metadata to find patterns of disease manifestation and predictors of outcome.

Past projects
=============

* Protein folding prediction: Coarse-grained models to simulate ab-initio folding of protein molecules.
