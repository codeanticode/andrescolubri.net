I research new computational methods to predict the diagnosis and outcome of infectious disease patients, using demographic, clinical, and genomic data. My goal is to find ways to make these predictions useful to doctors at the clinic, or to the patients themselves. I also work on visual exploration tools to identify relevant patterns and predictors in  biomedical datasets.

Current projects
================

* Differentially Private Marchine Learning

* Unbiased visual exploration of biomedical data 

* Predictive modeling of infectious disease

* GPU-based visualization of large GIS datasets

Past projects
=============

* Ab-initio Protein Folding Prediction
