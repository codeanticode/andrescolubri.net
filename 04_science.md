I research new computational methods to predict the diagnosis and outcome of infectious disease patients, using demographic, clinical, and genomic data. My goal is to find ways to make these predictions useful to doctors at the clinic, or to the patients themselves. I also work on visual exploration tools to identify relevant patterns and predictors in  biomedical datasets.

My original background is in mathematics applied to the simulation of biopolymers (proteins and RNA). I obtained my PhD from the [department of Mathematics](http://www.matematica.uns.edu.ar/default.php) at the Universidad Nacional del Sur in Bah√≠a Blanca, Argentina, in 2002, for my work on the coarse-graining of stochastic processes to describe the folding of protein molecules ([thesis pdf, in Spanish]({{ site.url }}/assets/science/colubri-phd_thesis-uns.pdf)).


Current projects
================

* Differentially Private Marchine Learning

* Unbiased visual exploration of biomedical data 

* Predictive modeling of infectious disease

* GPU-based visualization of large GIS datasets

Past projects
=============

* Ab-initio Protein Folding Prediction

_I will be adding more information about these projects in the coming weeks._
