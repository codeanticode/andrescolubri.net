I research new computational methods to predict the diagnosis and outcome of infectious disease patients, using demographic, clinical, and genomic data. My goal is to find ways to make these predictions useful to doctors at the clinic, or to the patients themselves. I also work on visual exploration tools to identify relevant patterns and predictors in complex biomedical datasets.
